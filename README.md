# Pegasus-10-Original-Firmware
Posting the original Marlin Firmware 1.0.2 for the Makerfarm Pegasus 10 3D Printer

Note:  This may include personal configuration changes for my specific hardware, including but not limited to:
* Hot-end and thermistor configurations
* LCD type
* PID Tuning parameters
* Bang-Bang vs. MOSFET/PID heated bed controller
* Preheat preset customizations
* K-factor tuning parameters

These settings can be changed in `Configuration.h` or `Configuration_adv.h` to meet your specific needs.
